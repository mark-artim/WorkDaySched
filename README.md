# WorkDaySched
05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

The work day scheduler is a single page daily scheduler. You are able to see the working hours for a given day and add one event per hour. Working hours are hard coded from 8am to 5pm. You must click the save button in order for the event to be saved to local storage so that if you close the page and re-open it the events will remain. There is a Clear My Calendar button once you start a new day and need to clear prior events. This will clear all local starage for the page. The page will distinguish between past present and future events. Future events are green, teh present hour is red and past events are gray.
